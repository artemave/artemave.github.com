I am a vim user.

As such, I take continuously enhancing my vim-fu seriously, to keep impressing myself and, of course, others too. It is just fun. And not much beyond. Personally I don't understand the argument for learning vim 'because it makes you more productive'. I mean, things do get much faster in vim by all means, but if you are after productivity, mastering a text editor just does not seem to be the top priority. I don't think vim can (or should) be sold this way these days. Imagine Yoda saying 'Use the Force Luke - it will make you more productive'. They would have never made it past episode IV!

Learning other languages, reading other people's code and so on - that is what going to make you more productive.

However. It wasn't always like that. There were times when mastering vim moves was the matter of life and death. A lot of what I largely consider as a way to show off (perhaps even recursive macros!) was once a prerequisite to getting things done. It was in the era of Slowness. Slow terminals. Or teletypes. Or God knows what else, but the point is that a war could have started and finished before user input would show up as output. No wonder people were getting far more advanced in far shorter time than I am today.

This first occurred to me once when I got stuck editing a perl script over ssh tunnel through two (or three?) servers. Don't ask me how I got into this situation. Sometimes shit like that just happens. So, things have gotten really slow and by the end of day two I found myself using moves I never even thought I knew. That got me thinking. What if there were some sort of a way to slow my everyday vim down? That would naturally force me to trade the amount of keystrokes to their more efficient vim alternatives.

And that is how [SlowDown.vim](https://github.com/artemave/slowdown.vim) was born. Perhaps the only vim plugin on the planet that (deliberately) makes user experience worse. And possibly the smallest one too.

Check it out. It is fun!
